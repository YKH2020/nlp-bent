# Agent for Philosophical Ideologies

## Problem Statement
As we technologically advance, we often stray from the humanities and focus more on practical fields. However, there should still be emphasis on core aspects of the humanities, like philosophy, as we often unknowingly use prevalent themes in the field to drive our moral and ethical code in advancement today. Our goal is to construct a model to better comprehend philsophical thoughts, and be able to interact with the prompter to provide insights that may be hard to come by online or difficult to digest from dense articles.

## Data
Our data was utilized from the following source: https://huggingface.co/datasets/AiresPucrs/stanford-encyclopedia-philosophy. Stanford Encyclopedia data on philosophy was chunked and labeled with philsophical related headers. This data was then cropped and used to refine our model responses in its related philosophical areas.

## Models

### Naive Approach

### Traditional Approach

### Deep Learning Approach

## Evaluation
We took multiple approaches to evaluation. 

### Assesment from a knowledgable person
One of our team members conducted research before prompting, assembling relevant sources and using their own reasoning to assess the models output. This member then assessed whether the model gave a well-written response.
