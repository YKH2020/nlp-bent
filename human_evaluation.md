## Question: Can you tell me about alienation in a classical philosophy lens?

### Naive
Answer: 1. Alienation is a concept that is often used in philosophy to describe the experience of being disconnected from one's self, one's community, and one's world. In a classical philosophical context, alienation is often seen as a result of the separation of the individual from the community, and the loss of connection to the world. This can be seen in the work of Marx, who argued that the separation of the individual from the community leads to a loss of connection to the world.

In the context of the history of philosophy, it has been used to refer to a variety of phenomena, including the alienation of the individual from the community, the alienation of the individual from the natural world, and the alienation of the individual from the divine.

### Analysis
Alienation in classical philosophy closely relates to God, assessing one's self within emotionally and physically, and outwardly. Both responses do this to a varying degree, with the naive lacking the theology aspect while the fine-tuned lacking more contextual knowledge. Both were decent but lacking in some ways.

### Analysis
Dewey's view on impulsion was that it generated artistic development, allowing the nuance of techniques that allow art to reach beyond its physical form.

The naive outperforms, doing decently well, but the fine tune is worse, and begins to repeat itself.
